      <p>Mu Qing is a prideful and stubborn man who is often sarcastic, cold and dismissive towards those around him. The overarching theme of Mu Qing’s personality is the clash between his scornful exterior and his actual intent.  Xie Lian describes him as someone narrow-minded, sensitive, petty and skeptical who is constantly offending other people, but still possesses principles. Eventually it is shown that Mu Qing is indeed someone caring and thoughtful, yet due to his usually cold, sneering demeanor, people assume the worst of him whenever he does try to do good or they simply don’t believe him
